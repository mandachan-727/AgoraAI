### 🚀 Problem Statement
A single college course can cost over $7,000—nearly $500 per class. Yet, many students sit through lackluster discussions where disengaged peers and poorly structured conversations dilute the learning experience. 

- **68% of students** say unprepared classmates weaken discussions. *(Source: NSSE, 2023)*  
- **72% of instructors** struggle to form meaningful discussion groups without insights into student knowledge. *(Source: Chronicle of Higher Education, 2023)*  
- Faculty spend **30% more time** managing discussions when they lack data on student participation. *(Source: Teaching and Learning Inquiry, 2022)*  

Agora AI flips the script by transforming pre-class work into a strategic advantage, equipping instructors with the insights needed to spark **dynamic, inclusive, and high-impact discussions.**
