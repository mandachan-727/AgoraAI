# Project Overview
## ❗ Problem:
Discussion-based university classrooms often fail to deliver consistent learning experiences. 

### 🧠 Context:
Especially in humanities and social sciences courses, learning relies heavily on peer dialogue and group discussion.
But the quality of that learning experience is highly dependent on how engaged and intentional students’ peers are.
When peers are unprepared, passive, or surface-level, discussions feel empty — leading to missed learning opportunities.

### 🧩 The Orchestration Challenge (Instructor Pain Point):
Instructors struggle to:
See what students are thinking before class
Form groups that lead to rich, engaging conversations
Scaffold individualized participation in real time
Traditional classroom management tools do not account for:
Students’ prior contributions or knowledge
Differences in discussion styles or ideologies
Personalized entry points into complex texts or questions

### 🎯 Learning Consequences:
Uneven quality of group discussions across the class
Lower student motivation and participation (especially for quieter students)
Inconsistent learning outcomes — equity gap widens even within a single classroom
Instructors spend time managing logistics instead of focusing on facilitation

### 💸 Business Consequence (Perceived Value of Education):
Classroom experiences serve as a core metric by which students evaluate the worth of their university education. When group discussions fall flat, students can feel like they’re not getting their money’s worth, regardless of how good the syllabus or instructor is. This leads to:
Lower course satisfaction scores and course reviews
Increased pressure on faculty and departments to “fix engagement” without added support
Greater scrutiny of the cost vs. value proposition of a university education — especially in humanities and social sciences, where job-linked ROI is already under debate
A tool that improves the consistency and quality of classroom experiences directly enhances the perceived and actual value of classroom time.

## 🤖 Opportunity for AI:
AI can act as a co-orchestrator, helping ensure every student is placed in a group where they can contribute meaningfully.
AI can use prior student inputs (e.g., Perusall annotations, discussion histories) to:
Form smarter small groups aligned to instructional goals (e.g., deepen ideas, challenge assumptions, broaden perspectives)
Generate personalized nudges or prompts that help students enter discussions with purpose and confidence

## 🧪 This Project Aims to:
Build a prototype that uses mock annotation data and instructor inputs to:
Optimize student groupings for discussion-based learning
Provide tailored entry points (nudges) for each student based on their previous thinking
Deliver this through a lightweight, facilitator-facing interface that fits within existing class routines
