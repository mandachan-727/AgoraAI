### **Discussion Goals**  

- **Deepen Text Interpretation**  
  The facilitator clusters students based on diverse interpretations and assigns them prompts that challenge their perspectives, encouraging textual analysis, inferencing, and synthesis to refine collective understanding.  

- **Encourage Elaboration & Connections**  
  Groups are formed with students who hold related yet distinct ideas, prompting them to expand on each otherâ€™s points, link concepts to real-world contexts, and articulate deeper connections across themes.  

- **Stimulate Questioning & Uncertainty Identification**  
  Students are grouped to include differing levels of confidence in the topic. They are prompted to challenge assumptions, identify ambiguities, and collaboratively refine their understanding by generating and addressing critical questions.  

- **Promote Conceptual Clarification**  
  The facilitator organizes students with varying levels of clarity on key concepts, assigning them prompts that require defining, contrasting, and refining ideas to establish shared, well-articulated conceptual understandings.  

- **Foster Consensus Building**  
  Students with differing viewpoints are placed together and guided to navigate disagreements, evaluate evidence, and reach reasoned agreements, ensuring balanced discussions that integrate multiple perspectives into a coherent synthesis.  

- **Provide Peer Support**  
  Groups combine students with stronger and weaker grasp of topics, allowing for reciprocal teaching where explanations, clarifications, and scaffolding strengthen collective learning while fostering a supportive discussion environment.  

- **Explore & Address Conflicting Perspectives**  
  The facilitator forms groups with opposing viewpoints and prompts them to critically engage, recognize underlying assumptions, and constructively negotiate differences while maintaining open, respectful discourse.

### **Mode of Interaction**  

- **Debate: Argue Conflicting Understandings**  
  Students with opposing perspectives are grouped and assigned roles that require defending, critiquing, and refining their arguments, fostering critical thinking, persuasive reasoning, and engagement with counterarguments.  

- **Informing: One Student Explains to Others**  
  Groups include knowledge disparities where informed students act as peer educators, explaining concepts, providing examples, and clarifying misunderstandings, reinforcing learning through structured knowledge-sharing.  

- **Co-construction: Collaboratively Build a Shared Understanding**  
  Students with complementary knowledge work together to integrate insights, refine collective interpretations, and construct nuanced understandings, ensuring active participation and mutual idea development.  

- **Building Understanding Towards an Answer: Develop Foundational Concepts**  
  Groups engage in stepwise knowledge-building, collectively identifying gaps, structuring foundational ideas, and synthesizing key insights, leading to stronger conceptual frameworks and deeper comprehension.
